        <p>Â¡Hola! I'm a proud Cuban native who grew up in the vibrant city of Miami, FL. As a native Spanish
          speaker, I effortlessly navigate between languages, which has enriched my ability to connect with people
          from different cultures throughout my upbringing. After an almost decade long career in Hospitality and
          Events, I am persuing my education as a Full Stack Web Developer. My love of technology spans as far
          back as dial-up days and MySpace forums.</p>

        <p>When I'm not coding, you'll often find me engrossed in the world of cinema, my favorite film being
          Interstellar! I also have a passion for entrepreneurship and have even started two businesses in the
          last three years. My self-starter attitude has opened many doors for me and I hope to grow in the tech
          industry as I continue my learning. Below are my first few projects as well as other technical skills I
          have developed throughout my career.</p>
